# Spider Monkey Optimization - Travel Salesman Problem

This repository contains an implementation of the Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) algorithm applied to the Travel Salesman Problem (TSP) in Java. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city.

## :dart: About ##

The Spider Monkey Optimization algorithm mimics the social behavior of spider monkeys to solve optimization problems effectively. In this project, we leverage this nature-inspired algorithm to address the Travel Salesman Problem, providing a competitive solution compared to traditional methods.

## :sparkles: Features ##

- **Spider Monkey Optimization Algorithm**: Efficiently optimizes the route for the TSP.
- **Customizable Input**: Users can define their own set of cities and distances.
- **Performance Visualization**: Visualize the optimization process and results through plots (if applicable).

## :rocket: Technologies ##

The following technologies were used in this project:

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) (for visualization, if applicable)

## :white_check_mark: Requirements ##

To run this project, you'll need:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed on your machine.
